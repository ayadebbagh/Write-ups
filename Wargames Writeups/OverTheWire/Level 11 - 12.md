"The password for the next level is stored in the fileÂ **data.txt**, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions"

Since the last challenge had a command to decrypt the message I assumed there was a command to decrypt ROT 13 messages, I was wrong. From looking up all the recommended commands, i see that `tr` would be the most suitable choice for the task. To shift the letters 13 spaces, we can define the first range as 'A-Za-z' and the second range as 'N-ZA-Mn-za-n'.
