"The password for the next level is stored in the fileÂ **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work."

First, let's understand what a hex dump is:
A hex dump is a textual display of binary data (from a file, memory, or storage device) presented in hexadecimal, a base-16 number system.

After making a directory in `/tmp` and copying `data.txt`, we can use `xxd -r hexdump.txt compressed.txt` to reverse the hexdump and have the compressed data in compressed.txt `. To get more information on the file, we can use ` file compressed.txt ` which tells us that it is a gzip compressed data file. When doing ` gzip -d compressed.txt `, we get a ` gzip: data3.txt: unknown suffix -- ignored `. This tells me that the file needs to have the right extension to be able to use gzip
We rename `data3.txt` to `data3.txt.gz` and unzip it. We get a `data3.txt` file back. We can use `file` again to get more information, and we learn that this new file is a bzip2 compressed data file. Doing the same thing again, we rename `data3.txt` to `data3.txt.bz2`, decompress it with `bsip2 -d data3.txt.bz2` which gives us
