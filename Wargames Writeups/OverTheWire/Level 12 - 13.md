"The password for the next level is stored in the fileÂ **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work."

A hex dump is a textual display of binary data (from a file, memory, or storage device) presented in hexadecimal, a base-16 number system.
